# petrock-ingest

This is a background service for interacting with the [RetroMMO](https://retro-mmo.com/) API, designed specifically for [Petrock](https://github.com/robertwayne/petrock). It ingests data regularly, processes it, then pushes it off to the database for use by the Petrock API.

*This is a WIP rewrite of the old `petrock-service-runner`, which can still be found in the Petrock repository under the `__OLDSERVER` directory.*
